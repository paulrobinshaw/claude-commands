   ```

3. **Set up test project:**
   ```bash
   # In a separate directory
   mkdir test-project
   cd test-project
   # Create test SwiftUI project
   # Link to your claude-commands fork
   ln -s path/to/your/claude-commands .claude-commands
   mkdir -p .claude/commands
   cd .claude/commands
   ln -s ../../.claude-commands/commands/core/prime.md prime
   ln -s ../../.claude-commands/commands/core/feature.md feature
   ```

## Coding Standards

### Markdown Commands

**File naming:**
- Use kebab-case: `feature-planner.md` (NOT `FeaturePlanner.md`)
- Be descriptive: `swiftui-feature.md` (NOT `feature.md` in swiftui/)
- Use `.md` extension

**Structure:**
```markdown
# Title

Brief description.

---

## What This Does

1-3 sentences

---

## Instructions

Step-by-step instructions for Claude

## Step 1: [Name]

Details...

---

## Notes

- Implementation notes
- Edge cases
- Future improvements
```

**Writing style:**
- Be concise and clear
- Use active voice
- Include examples
- Think step-by-step
- Assume Claude will follow literally

### Code Examples

**In markdown:**
````markdown
```swift
// SwiftUI example
@Observable
class RecipeService {

}
```
````

**Best practices:**
- Use syntax highlighting
- Include imports
- Show complete examples

## Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing

**Before submitting PR:**

1. **Prime test:**
   ```
   /prime
   ```
   - Verify technology detection
   - Check context loading
   - Confirm customization detection

2. **Feature test:**
   ```
   /feature "add user authentication"
   ```
   - Verify plan generation
   - Check architecture compliance
   - Confirm output location

3. **Domain test (if applicable):**
   ```
   /feature "add recipe scaling"
   ```
   - Verify domain loading
   - Check domain usage in plan

4. **Error handling test:**
   ```
   /feature   # No description
   ```
   - Verify error message
   - Check graceful handling

### Test Checklist

- [ ] Commands execute without errors
- [ ] Output is properly formatted
- [ ] Architecture patterns followed
- [ ] Design system tokens used (if applicable)

## Adding New Technologies

Want to add React or Python support? Here's how:

### Step 1: Create Technology Directory

```bash
mkdir commands/[technology]
```

### Step 2: Create Primer

`commands/[technology]/prime.md`:
- Detect technology
- Load architecture
- Report customization

### Step 3: Create Architecture

`commands/[technology]/architecture.md`:
- Define patterns
- Document conventions
- Provide examples

### Step 4: Create Feature Planner

`commands/[technology]/feature.md`:
- Smart context loading
- Plan generation
- Architecture enforcement

### Step 5: Update Core

Add detection to `commands/core/prime.md`:
```markdown
### [Technology] Detection
[detection commands]

If found â†’ Route to commands/[technology]/prime.md
```

### Step 6: Update Router

Add routing to `commands/routers/feature.md`:
```markdown
### If [Technology]
Execute: commands/[technology]/feature.md
```

### Step 7: Test

Create test project and verify:
- Detection works
- Routing works
- Plans generate correctly

### Step 8: Document

- Update README.md
- Add examples
- Update ARCHITECTURE.md
