## What is This?

Claude Commands is a collection of **slash command templates** for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) that help you:

- =ï¿½ **Plan features** with architecture patterns built-in
- <ï¿½ **Maintain consistency** across your codebase
- =ï¿½ **Move faster** with smart context loading
- =ï¿½ **Document domain knowledge** for AI-assisted development
- <ï¿½ **Enforce design systems** automatically

**Philosophy:** Load minimal context, follow established patterns, generate high-quality code.

---

```

**Speed:** < 2 seconds

---

### `/feature` - Plan a Feature

**What it does:**
- Auto-loads design system (if UI feature)
- Auto-loads domain knowledge (if business logic)

**Context:** 0-10K tokens (depends on feature type)

---

### `/bug` - Plan a Bug Fix

**What it does:**
- Analyzes the issue
- Identifies root cause
- Generates fix plan with steps
- Outputs to `specs/bug-*.md`

**Usage:**
```
/bug "login fails when email contains plus sign"
/bug "app crashes on iPad in landscape mode"
```

**Output:** `specs/bug-[name].md` with:
- Issue description
- Root cause analysis
- Fix strategy
- Implementation steps
- Testing verification

---

### `/chore` - Plan a Refactor/Chore

**What it does:**
- Plans refactoring or maintenance
- Identifies files to modify
- Generates step-by-step plan
- Outputs to `specs/chore-*.md`

**Usage:**

- Step-by-step plan
- Testing strategy

---

## Managing Specs

After implementing features, you can archive completed specs to keep your `specs/` directory clean.

### Archive Single Spec

```bash
./scripts/archive-spec.sh specs/feature-dark-mode.md
```

**Result:** Spec moved to `specs/done/2025-10-17-2154-feature-dark-mode.md`

### Archive All Specs

```bash
./scripts/archive-all-specs.sh
```

Archives all `.md` files in `specs/` directory with timestamps.

### View Archived Specs

```bash
# List archived specs (sorted by time)
ls -lt specs/done/

# View a specific archived spec
cat specs/done/2025-10-17-2154-feature-dark-mode.md
```

**Timestamp format:** `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-filename.md` (sortable and human-readable)

---

## Customization

Claude Commands is designed to be **fully customizable** for your project.

### 1. Design System (Optional)

Define your colors, typography, spacing, etc.

```bash
# Copy template
cp templates/design-system-template.md .claude/project/design-system.md

# Customize for your brand
# - Add your color palette
# - Define typography scale
# - Document spacing system
# - etc.
```

**When loaded:** Automatically for UI features (keywords: screen, view, button, card, etc.)

**Example:** See `examples/baking-app/design-system.md` for metric colors and baking-specific UI

---

### 2. Domain Knowledge (Optional)

Document your business domain - entities, calculations, workflows, validation rules.

```bash
# Copy template
cp templates/domain-template.md .claude/project/domain.md

# Document your domain
# - Define entities (User, Order, Recipe, etc.)
# - Add calculations (tax, shipping, percentages)
# - Document workflows (checkout, approval, etc.)
# - Add validation rules
```

**When loaded:** Automatically for domain features (your custom keywords + calculation, formula, etc.)

**Example:** See `examples/baking-app/domain.md` for baker's percentages and formulas

---

### 3. Version Strategy (Optional)

Define minimum versions, patterns to use/avoid, migration strategy.

```bash
# Copy template
cp templates/version-template.md .claude/project/version.md

# Define your strategy
# - Set minimum supported version
# - List patterns to use ()
# - List patterns to avoid (L)
# - Document migration path
```

**When loaded:** Always (small file, ~500 tokens)

**Example:** See `examples/baking-app/version.md` for iOS 17+ with @Observable pattern

---

### 4. MCP Configuration (Optional)

Configure build/test/git automation (Model Context Protocol).

```bash
# Copy template
cp templates/mcp-template.md .claude/project/mcp.md

# Configure for your build system
# - Add build commands (Xcode, Gradle, npm)
# - Add test commands
# - Add pre-commit validation
```

**When loaded:** Always (small file, ~500 tokens)

**Example:** See `examples/baking-app/mcp.md` for XcodeBuildMCP with architecture validation

---

## Architecture

### Command Flow

```
User: /feature "add dark mode"
  ï¿½
core/feature.md (entry point)
  ï¿½ (check if primed)
routers/feature.md (detect technology)
  ï¿½ (route to SwiftUI)
swiftui/feature.md (SwiftUI-specific planner)
  ï¿½ (detect UI keywords)
loaders/design-system.md (auto-load design system)
  ï¿½
Generate plan ï¿½ specs/feature-dark-mode.md
```

### Context Loading Strategy

**Lazy Loading:**
- Core architecture: Always loaded (~3K tokens)
- Design system: Loaded only for UI features (~2K tokens)
- Domain knowledge: Loaded only for business logic (~5K tokens)
- Version/MCP: Always loaded (~1K tokens)

**Benefits:**
- Fast (< 2 seconds for prime)
- Efficient (< 5% of context window)
- Smart (only loads what's needed)

**See:** `ARCHITECTURE.md` for detailed system design

---

## Examples

### Professional Baking App

Complete example showing customization for a professional baking application:

**Features:**
- Metric colors for visualizing baker's percentages (flour, water, salt, yeast)
- Domain knowledge for baker's percentages and formulas
- iOS 17+ version strategy with @Observable pattern
- XcodeBuildMCP configuration with pre-commit validation

**Location:** `examples/baking-app/`

**Files:**
- `design-system.md` - Metric colors and baking UI components
- `domain.md` - Baker's percentages, formulas, calculations, workflows
- `version.md` - iOS 17+ strategy, patterns to use/avoid

## Why Claude Commands?

### Before Claude Commands

```
User: "Add dark mode"
Claude: "I'll add dark mode. Here's the code:"
  ï¿½ Hardcoded colors: Color(red: 0.2, green: 0.3, blue: 0.5)
  ï¿½ Random patterns: ObservableObject ViewModel
  ï¿½ Inconsistent: Every feature looks different
  ï¿½ No tests: "I'll leave testing to you"
```

### After Claude Commands

```
User: /feature "add dark mode"
Claude:
   Auto-loaded design system
   Using DS.Colors.* tokens
   Following @Observable pattern
   Generating comprehensive plan with tests

Output: specs/feature-dark-mode.md
  - Architecture-compliant
  - Design system enforced
  - Testing included
  - Ready to implement
```

### Benefits

1. **Consistency** - Every feature follows the same patterns
2. **Quality** - Architecture patterns built-in
3. **Speed** - Lazy loading keeps context small
4. **Documentation** - Domain knowledge captured
5. **Enforcement** - Design system tokens required

---

## Requirements

- **Claude Code** - Claude 3.5 Sonnet or later
- **Git** - For installation and version control
- **Project** - Using a supported technology (SwiftUI v1.0, React/Python coming soon)
